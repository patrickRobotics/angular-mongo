# Go Full-stack with Node.js, Express and MongoDb
This is a repository for the course available at https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5614116-go-full-stack-with-node-js-express-and-mongodb. It entails implementation of the backend for a sample app with frontend writen in AngularJS found at  https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/5614116-front-end-app.git.
This is not to serve as a step-by-step implementation of courses materials so I just commited the last step after completing the course.

Instructions to set up the environment can be found at the frontend's repository linked above.
